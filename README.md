# Intro

First off, a quick summary of how all this code works is that; it dosen't. 
Ok, well it does, it's just that it could be a tad bit more optimised, I just don't feel like it.
And, all things considered for how big the processes it's doing, it run's fairly fast. Just not *100%* efficently, like 87.65% efficently

## Download file

There are multiple options to download the file. 
The most practical being, using git. If you have a git envrioment set up, use the command:

git clone Um-bel/Wordle-Helper
or
git clone https://github.com/Um-bel/Wordle-Helper
```
The second most common would downloading through github. In the top right of the page click "Code" then, click "Download ZIP". Navigate to the location of the file, and extract it to the enviroment of your choice
